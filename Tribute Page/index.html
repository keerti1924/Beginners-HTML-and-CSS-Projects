                    <h2>Father of the Nation</h2>
                    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 - 30 January 1948) was the leader of the Indian
                        independence
                        movement
                        against British rule. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence
                        and
                        inspired
                        movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā applied to him
                        first
                        in
                        1914
                        in
                        South Africa is now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for
                        "father")
                        and
                        Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation.</p>
